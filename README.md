A log to keep my thoughts, built using FireStore

Currently an extremely crude logger, since I was trying to work with FireStore for the first time.

### What I learnt:

* Learned a lot about how Promises work in JS 
    
* FireStore Basics

* Also learned some CSS stuff which I'll probably never use again

### Next

* Remake it with React

* Add planned Features

* FireBase Auth
